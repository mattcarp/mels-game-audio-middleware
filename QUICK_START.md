   🎮 Day 1 of my game audio journey!
   
   Just created my first adaptive audio system in FMOD:
   ✅ Footsteps that change with surface type
   ✅ Randomized jump sounds to prevent fatigue  
   ✅ Dynamic music that responds to gameplay
   
   As an audio engineer diving into games, I'm amazed 
   how middleware makes interactivity so intuitive!

3. Make the coin pitch up with combo count
4. Share what you learned!

## 🔥 Pro Tips for Fast Progress:
