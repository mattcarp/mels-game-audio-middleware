   - Go to fmod.com
   - Get the free version
   - Install it (works on any computer)

2. **Open FMOD and Create New Project**

### ⏰ Next 30 Minutes: Your First Interactive Audio

#### Create a Footstep System:
1. **In FMOD:**

   - Name it "Footstep"
   - Drag your footstep sounds onto the timeline

2. **Make It Interactive:**
   - Add a Parameter (right panel → Add Parameter)

   - Set range 0-2 (for 3 surface types)

3. **Add Variation:**
   - Right-click on timeline → Add Multi Instrument
   - Drop all footstep sounds in
   - This randomizes which plays!

4. **Test It:**
   - Press Play
   - Move the Surface parameter slider
   - Hear your first adaptive audio!

### ⏰ Next 30 Minutes: Create Game-Ready Audio

#### Build Three Essential Events:
1. **Jump Sound**
   - New Event called "Jump"
   - Add jump/whoosh sound
   - Add Pitch Randomization (±10%)
   - This prevents repetition fatigue!

2. **Coin Collect**
   - New Event called "Coin"
   - Add coin sound
   - Add AHDSR Modulator on volume
   - Quick attack, quick release = snappy!

3. **Background Music**

   - Automate volume based on Intensity

### ⏰ Final 30 Minutes: Package and Portfolio


1. **Build Your Sound Bank:**
   - File → Build
   - Select all events
   - Build for Desktop
   - This creates game-ready files!

2. **Record a Demo Video:**
   - Use OBS (free) or any screen recorder
   - Show each event working
   - Explain what makes them adaptive
   - 2-3 minutes max

3. **Create LinkedIn Post:**
   ```
   🎮 Day 1 of my game audio journey!
   
   Just created my first adaptive audio system in FMOD:
   ✅ Footsteps that change with surface type
   ✅ Randomized jump sounds to prevent fatigue  
   ✅ Dynamic music that responds to gameplay
   
   As an audio engineer diving into games, I'm amazed 
   how middleware makes interactivity so intuitive!

## 🎯 Congratulations! You've just:
- ✅ Created adaptive audio (most people never get this far!)
- ✅ Used professional tools (same as AAA games)
- ✅ Built portfolio content (this counts!)
- ✅ Started your public learning journey

## 💪 Tomorrow's Challenge:
1. Add one new parameter to footsteps (wetness? speed?)
2. Create a "damaged" state for the music
3. Make the coin pitch up with combo count
4. Share what you learned!

## 🔥 Pro Tips for Fast Progress:
- **Work in public** - Post daily progress
- **Embrace "bad"** - Your first attempts should suck
- **Copy shamelessly** - Recreate sounds from games you love
- **Ask questions** - The community loves helping beginners
- **Document everything** - Today's obvious is tomorrow's forgotten

## 📱 Mobile Quick Reference:
**Daily 15-Minute Practice:**
- Morning: Watch one FMOD/Wwise tutorial video
- Lunch: Read one game audio article
- Evening: Implement one small feature

**Weekly Goals:**
- Monday: New technique learned
- Wednesday: Implementation attempted  
- Friday: Share progress online
- Sunday: Review and plan next week

Remember Melissa: Every expert was once a disaster. 
The only difference? They kept showing up.

**Your first game audio system is DONE.** 
Tomorrow, make your second. 
Then your third.
Soon, you'll lose count.
